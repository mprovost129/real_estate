API Access
To get data, target the odata based Web API like so:


Copy
https://api.mlsgrid.com/v2/Property?$filter=OriginatingSystemName%20eq%20%27actris%27%20and%20ModificationTimestamp%20gt%202020-12-30T23:59:59.99Z&$expand=Media,Rooms,UnitTypes
With the following header

Header

Value

Authorization

Bearer access_token

Explanation of the URI segments

The URL shown above has the following segments (with explanations)

Segment

Description

https://api.mlsgrid.com/v2/

The main location of the API Service for now and the future

Property

The resource name for the data that you want to download

$filter

Using an odata query. This is limited for replication purposes.

$expand

Contains the list of expanded resource types you want included in the returned data.

All data is compressed using gzip compression to shrink the overall payload size.

Limitations of Replication API
At this writing there are several limitations imposed on the Web API for the purpose of replication. These limitations are imposed to make the generally heavy odata faster for this specific use case. 

Here are limitations imposed:

Limitation

Description

OriginatingSystemName

Each request must contain a single OriginatingSystemName specified in the filter criteria of the request. 

Searchable Fields

There are only a few fields you can query the service with. This includes timestamp and status fields. See below for a list of all fields.

$expand calls

$expand is limited to specific resources and types due to the custom nature of our API service. Please see the Expanded Resources section of the docs for more information.  We do not support $select or $orderby on the $expand resources.

NOTE: If you use expand in the request, the records per request limit reduces to 1000 at most per request. If you set $top=2000 or 5000 for example you will receive an error.

5000 records per request

You can receive at most 5000 records per request. If you set $top=6000, for example, you will receive an error. The application will default to 500 records per request if not specified.

or operator

The query must include no more than 5 'or' operators per query. 

NOTE: It is preferred to use the in operator instead which is new in version 2.0.

Otherwise, users can select for specific fields as expected using the $select param in the URL.

Replication
Here are some examples of how you will use this API for replication. All examples assume the use of the headers being set properly for authentication purposes.

Initial Import

This is what the initial import request will look like:


Copy
https://api.mlsgrid.com/v2/Property?$filter=OriginatingSystemName%20eq%20%27actris%27%20and%20MlgCanView%20eq%20true
The initial import would grab the first "page" of data. We don't want any deleted records so we set MlgCanView to being "equal" to true. 

Next Link
To get the next page of data from the request, as part of the response body you will find a field called @odata.nextLink which contains a url. You can use this url as the next request to page through the data.  You would continue to use the next link to get the next page of data until the response no longer contains a next link.  Here is a snippet that shows what the next link looks like in the json. 


Copy
            "MlgCanView": true,
            "ModificationTimestamp": "2019-02-01T00:55:41.516Z",
            "OriginatingSystemName": "actris"
        }
    ],
    "@odata.nextLink": "https://api.mlsgrid.com/v2/Property?$filter=OriginatingSystemName%20eq%20'actris'%20and%20MlgCanView%20eq%20true&$expand=Media%2CRooms%2CUnitTypes&$top=1000&$skip=4000"
}
Errors during import

If you encounter an error during your initial import you can avoid re-downloading any records that you already received and continue where you left off by adding the ModificationTimestamp that you last received to the initial import query:


Copy
https://api.mlsgrid.com/v2/Property?$filter=OriginatingSystemName%20eq%20%27actris%27%20and%20MlgCanView%20eq%20true%20and%20ModificationTimestamp%20gt%202020-12-12T00:00:00.000Z&$expand=Media,Rooms,UnitTypes
We order our requests by ModificationTimestamp by default so that you do not miss changes that occur during your download and so that you can pick up where you left off in this manner. 

After Initial Import

After you have the initial data fully downloaded, you would switch to using replication queries which do not contain an MlgCanView filter in them. This allows you to get all changes to the data including changes to MlgCanView=false so that you know when data is removed from the feed and needs to be deleted from your local data store. If you choose to store only a subset of the data in your local data store, your replication queries need to contain the greatest ModificationTimestamp you have received in the data from the api regardless of whether or not you choose to store the records you receive.  This avoids repulling the same data over and over again. 

Here is an example replication query:


Copy
https://api.mlsgrid.com/v2/Property?$filter=OriginatingSystemName%20eq%20%27actris%27%20and%20ModificationTimestamp%20gt%202019-02-04T23:59:59.99Z&$expand=Media,Rooms,UnitTypes
This should be very familiar to anyone who has used RETS before and needed to replicate over that service.

Signal Fields
The following fields when they have changed indicate that action must be taken by the consumer with regard to their local data store. 

Resource or Expanded Resource

Field

Action to Take

ALL

ModificationTimestamp

The record data has changed, replace the contents of your local copy of the record with the updated copy received during replication. 

ALL

MlgCanView

When changed to false, the record is no longer valid for the feed type you consume and must be removed from your local data store.

Property, Member, Office

PhotosChangeTimestamp

This value will not change without also having the ModificationTimestamp change. If this timestamp changes, it means that the media records have changed. Replace the contents of your local copy of any media records with the updated copies received during replication.  Pay attention to any MediaModificationTimestamp updates as noted below.

Media

MediaModificationTimestamp

This value exists on the Media subdocuments of a Property, Member, or Office record. None of these values will change without also having the ModificationTimestamp of the Property, Member, or Office record change. During regular replication, if the MediaModificationTimestamp of a media record is new or different from what you had before, the image file has changed and needs to be re-downloaded using the MediaURL of the media record.

Here is an example of a typical sequence of events for how to use these signal fields when receiving updates to records. 

Query the API for updates using the greatest ModificationTimestamp from your local database for this resource. 

While saving each record received, take the following steps: 

Look to see if the MlgCanView field is false.  If it is, delete or mark your local data copy to be deleted from your data set. 

Look to see if the PhotosChangeTimestamp has changed since the last time you received this record. If it has changed, then replace your local media records with the ones you've received in the update. 

The key of the Media record is the MediaKey. Match up your records by the MediaKey. If you received a new MediaKey, or a MediaKey you did not previously have, download that image using the MediaURL.

If the MediaKey no longer exists mark that record deleted. 

After taking all needed action, save off the ModificationTimestamp as the greatest ModificationTimestamp you have received back from the API for this resource and then repeat for the next record. 

Metadata
Use this endpoint to access the metadata for the API.

https://api.mlsgrid.com/v2/$metadata?$filter=OriginatingSystemName%20eq%20%27actris%27
Resource Naming
The following is a list of the resource names (or entity sets) to use in the request URL.

Resource Endpoint

Expandable Resources

Description

Property

Media,

Rooms,

UnitTypes

Property Resource. This resource contains all listings for sale or lease.

Member

Media

Member Resource

Office

Media

Office Resource

OpenHouse

-

OpenHouse Resource

Lookup

-

Lookup Resource

Expanded Resources
The expanded resources are a sub document of the resource that they belong to. For example the Media records exist as an array of records called Media on the Property Record and are given through the api as part of the Property record.  If the ModificationTimestamp of the Property record changes, the contents of the Media sub document should be replaced by whatever is returned in the updated record.

The following is a list of the expandable resources and their corresponding Resource Names that have the ability to expand them. This is basically the same list as above but inverted:

Expanded Resource Name

Resources that can expand this resource

Description

Media

Property,

Member,

Office

Media expandable resource. These are the media files associated with a Property, Member, or Office record.

Rooms

Property

Rooms expandable resource. These are the Room records associated with a Property record.

UnitTypes

Property

UnitTypes expandable resource. These are the UnitType records associated with a Property record.

Rooms and UnitTypes
RESO expects these expanded collections to be named differently on the records they are expanded onto.  These collections are referenced in the nav links in the resource metadata.  This is how the requests and data look:

Metadata
The field name of the data in the Property or other resource record will match the name in the nav link located in the resource it expands from.  The Type of the nav link will indicate what EntityType that field name corresponds to so that you can find the definition for that expanded type in the metadata.

Example Metadata Nav Links: 


Copy
<NavigationProperty Name="Rooms" Type="Collection(org.reso.metadata.PropertyRooms)"/>
<NavigationProperty Name="UnitTypes" Type="Collection(org.reso.metadata.PropertyUnitTypes)"/>
Example Expand Request:

                }
            ]
Deleted Records
MlgCanView - Deleted Listings, Off Market Listings, Etc

Each record in the system has a field called MlgCanView which is a boolean field and indicates whether the record should be kept in your database or not. This is how we have implemented our delete mechanism. When you receive an updated record during replication, you should first check this flag to see what action to take with your local copy of the record. 

IF true, then save or update the existing record in your db.

IF false, then remove the record from your database (or never save it in the first place).

This value can be changed to false based on a number of different reasons. 
The following are a few example reasons:  

The property was deleted.

The property listing office decided that they don't want to feed out any of their listings.

The property changed status and made it unavailable in IDX

Etc.

PLEASE NOTE: After 7 days records marked MlgCanView false will be removed from the data feed entirely.

The MlgCanView field is a specific field to the MLS Grid that tells you whether the record should be kept in your database. (note that any field with the prefix "Mlg" is specific to the Grid)

Deleted Expanded Resource Records
There is no delete flag for expanded resources as they exist as a part of the record they come with. As is the case with all other fields on the record, if you get records or values that are different than what you currently have, replace it with the new records and values you've received. If some of the data in your local data store no longer exists in the updated data that you received, remove it. 

MlgCanUse Field
Each record in the system has a field called MlgCanUse which is an array that helps indicate which of the Use Cases defined in the MLS Grid Master Data License Agreement the record qualifies for.

Each of the values in this field correspond to the data subscription types where the record may be found, and the possible Use Cases for each data subscription type are detailed below.

IDX Data Subscriptions
Records marked for IDX can be used in the Internet Data Exchange Program for public display on IDX websites AND in Customer Relationship Management and Transaction management tools.

Example MlgCanUse Field Output for IDX

Copy
"MlgCanUse": [
    "IDX"
]
VOW Data Subscriptions
Records marked for VOW can be used in the Virtual Office Website Program whereby a Internet website or a feature of a website is capable of providing real estate brokerage services to consumers where there exists a broker-consumer relationship. Additionally if the MlgCanUse field contains the IDX value, the records can also be used for the IDX Use Cases detailed above. Records that contain ONLY the VOW value can not be used for IDX Use Cases.

Example MlgCanUse Field Output for VOW

Copy
"MlgCanUse": [
    "VOW"
]

Copy
"MlgCanUse": [
    "IDX",
    "VOW"
]
Back Office (BO) Data Subscriptions
Records marked for Back Office (BO) can be used in Agent Production Analytics, Comparative Market Analysis, Real Estate Market Analytics, and Participant Listings Use (as each is defined in the MLS Grid Master Data License Agreement). Additionally if the MlgCanUse field contains the IDX and VOW values, the records can also be used for the IDX and VOW Use Cases detailed above. Records that contain ONLY the BO value can not be used for IDX or VOW Use Cases.

Example MlgCanUse Field Output for Back Office (BO)

Copy
"MlgCanUse": [
    "BO"
]

Copy
"MlgCanUse": [
    "VOW",
    "BO"
]

Copy
"MlgCanUse": [
    "IDX",
    "VOW",
    "BO"
]
Broker Only / Participant Data Access (PT) Data Subscriptions 
Records marked for Broker Only / Participant Data Access (PT) can be used solely for Participant Listings Use (as defined in the MLS Grid Master Data License Agreement).

Example MlgCanUse Field Output for Broker Only / Participant Data Access (PT)

Copy
"MlgCanUse": [
    "PT"
]
Example MlgCanUse Field Metadata
The MlgCanUse field can be found in the MLS Grid Metadata for each MLS.

     <Annotation String="https://docs.mlsgrid.com/api-documentation/api-version-2.0#mlgcanuse-field" Term="MLSGRID.Docs"/>
 </Property>
Media
The expanded media contains data describing photos associated with Properties, Members, and Offices.

The primary identifier of the media records is the MediaKey field.  This is the field that uniquely identifies a record.

In order to retrieve the photo associated with the media record, you will need to use the url provided in the MediaURL field to download the image. The url is for the highest resolution photo that the MLS provides to us.The URLs contained in the Media resource are to be used ONLY for the purpose of downloading a local copy of the image file. DO NOT use these URLs on your website or in your application.

Lookups
This resource contains all of the lookup values for an mls. We recommend using the following queries to replicate and keep your Lookup data up to date:

Initial Data Import Request

Copy
https://api.mlsgrid.com/v2/Lookup?$filter=OriginatingSystemName eq ‘actris’ and MlgCanView eq true
Regular Replication Requests

Copy
https://api.mlsgrid.com/v2/Lookup?$filter=OriginatingSystemName eq ‘actris’ and ModificationTimestamp gt [GREATEST ModificationTimestamp FROM YOUR DATABASE FOR THIS RESOURCE]
Replicate from this resource the same way you would replicate from any of the resources using the Greatest ModificationTimestamp from the records you've received so far when querying for the latest changes. 

Please do not pull from this resource more frequently than once a day as this resource will not likely change more than once a day. Pulling this resource with the same frequency as the rest of the resources may result in interruption of service for inefficient usage practices.

If you receive an update to MlgCanView: false on any of your lookup records, you should remove it from the list of possible values for that LookupName for the OriginatingSystemName on the record.

Example Lookup Record
The LookupKey is the primary identifier for this resource. Each record indicates that a lookup exists and is being used or not used by a particular mls depending on the value of the MlgCanView flag. The ModificationTimestamp will update whenever the Lookup record has changed.

    "MlgCanView": true
}
Example Field Metadata with a Lookup: 
Fields that have a lookup collection associated to it will appear like this in the metadata. In these 2 cases, the BodyType field uses a Lookup with the LookupName of BodyType in the Lookups collection. Possible values for this field can be found by looking in your local copy of the Lookups data for values assocated to the BodyType lookup. Same For StandardStatus.  Lookup values for StandardStatus have a LookupName of StandardStatus in the lookups collection and you can search your local copy of the lookups collection for values associated with the StandardStatus Lookup. 


Copy
<Property Name="BodyType" Type="Collection(Edm.String)">

Searchable Fields with Lookups
The PropertyType and StandardStatus fields are defined in the Lookups collection.  You can search by the lookup value for these fields when performing a request.

Example Query by StandardStatus Request:


Copy
https://api-demo.mlsgrid.com/v2/Property?$filter=StandardStatus eq 'Active Under Contract' and OriginatingSystemName eq 'actris'
StandardStatus
Querying by the StandardStatus field is a special case because it is enumerated.  The following example shows the syntax needed. 

To get all of the records that have an Active Under Contract StandardStatus, you must use the name of the status in order to query for it. (Note that in the table below the name is 'ActiveUnderContract' without spaces. These names are also contained in the StandardStatus enumeration metadata in the API but are provided here for convenience). 

This is the syntax for a request for all records with an Active Under Contract StandardStatus value: 


Copy
// Query by the name
https://api.mlsgrid.com/v2/Property?$filter=OriginatingSystemName%20eq%20%27actris%27%20and%20StandardStatus+eq+%27Active%20Under%20Contract%27
The following are the RESO Standard Status values we provide:

PropertyType
Querying by the PropertyType field is a special case because it is enumerated.  The following example shows the syntax needed. 

To get all of the records that have a PropertyType value of 'Commercial Sale', you must use the name of the PropertyType in order to query for it. (Note that in the table below the name is 'CommercialSale' without spaces. These names are also contained in the PropertyType enumeration metadata in the API but are provided here for convenience). 

This is the syntax for a request for all records with a Commercial Sale PropertyType value: 


Copy
// Query by the name
https://api.mlsgrid.com/v2/Property?$filter=OriginatingSystemName%20eq%20%27actris%27%20and%20PropertyType+eq+%27Commercial%20Sale%27

Prefixed KeyField Values
In order to maintain uniqueness across IDs, it is necessary to prefix our Key and MlsId fields throughout the data.  Any field that is a Key or an MlsId field or is a reference to a Key or MlsId field in one of our other resources will be prefixed with an MLS specific prefix.  This prefix should be removed from the data prior to displaying externally but must be added back whenever requesting records within the MLS Grid.  

Here are a few examples: 

If my ListingKey for a record in the MLS system was '123456' and my MLS's prefix was 'ACT', I would search in the MLS Grid for a record with a ListingKey equal to 'ACT123456'.  If I wanted to display this record on my website, I would display '123456' as the key on my website.  

If I have a problem with the OpenHouse records for one of my properties and I need to troubleshoot this specific record I might search for OpenHouse records by the MlsId of the property record. To find open house records for a property record, if the MlsId for the MLS's property record was '456789' and the MLS's prefix was 'ACT', I would search the OpenHouse resource for records where the ListingId is equal to 'ACT456789'.  

Finally, if I wanted to find the Member record in the MLS Grid for an MLS's property record with a ListAgentMlsId of 'A10001', I would search the Member resource for the MemberMlsId equal to 'ACTA10001'. If I also search for the Property record from the MLS Grid, I can expect that the ListAgentMlsId in the data would be equal to 'ACTA10001' which would match the MemberMlsId of the Member resource record I received.

PLEASE NOTE: Non-Alphanumeric characters can create issues with oData and the RESO Web API. For this purpose special characters must be stripped from the values provided in key fields.
